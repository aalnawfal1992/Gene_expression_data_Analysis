Paper titled “Prognostic Molecular Signatures for metastatic Potential in Clinically Low-Risk Stage I and II Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinomas”

The Expression profiling was made by high throughput sequencing.
The file summary is “Presented is the differen6al expression of mRNA and miRNA in 44 Stage I and Stage II pa6ents who developed metastasis within 5 years of nephrectomy, compared to 21 patients ts who remained disease free. Extracted RNA from nephrectomy specimens preserved in FFPE blocks was sequenced using RNAseq. MiRNA expression was done using the TaqMan OpenArray qPCR protocol.”
